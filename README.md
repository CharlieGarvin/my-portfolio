# My-Portfolio

## Description
I was tasked with creating a portfolio to store all of my work as I create new applications and website. I have implemented most of the HTML and CSS that I have learned so far. I will be 
updating my protfolio as I get better and a developer. It will be updated it terms of the styling of the page and the best completed projects I have at that given time.
